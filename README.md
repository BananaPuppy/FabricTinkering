# Fabric Tinkering

The Goal of this port is to as faithfully as possible re-create Tinkers Construct.<br>
With the intention of giving players a Fabric alternative, primarily for modpack creation.

This mod is in ***VERY EARLY ALPHA***.<br>
**MOST** features are currently missing.<br>
The features that are there are not fully implemented.


### **Current Goals**
Implement Base Materials, Parts, Tools, and TileEntities.<br>
Dynamically Generate Materials, Parts, and Tools<br>
Look into Structure generation (slime islands)
### **Some Notes**
- As much as possible, content should be implemented in a dynamic generative way
  - Give repo maintainers an easier time when catching up with Tinkers Construct parity
  - Allow extentions/addons for this mod to be developed with minimal mixin/conflicts
